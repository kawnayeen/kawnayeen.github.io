        <p>
            Let's imagine a scenario, your application consists of 10 or more microservices. It's really great,
            because of adopting microservice architecture, there's less conflict during development time; there's
            less probability of ending up with a messy codebase, cause each microservice is implementing one specific
            domain related features.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, all these good stuff of microservice architecture isn't free of cost. It's comes up with the
            huge price of deploying all the different services to roll out an update instead of deploying one
            monolithic application.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h5 class="text-left">Fault Tolerant Highly Available Infrastructure</h5>
        <p>
            When we are deploying our product for public usages, it doesn't matter whether we are deploying
            monolithic application or microservices, our infrastructure have to maintain atleaset the following
            criteria:-
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Zero downtime deployment option</li>
            <li>Scale up or down according to load</li>
            <li>Whenever an application become unhealthy, stop routing request to that application</li>
            <li>Infrastructure wise secured, meaning evil person can't do malicious action</li>
            <li>Incase of disaster scenario, recover from backup with minimum amount of data loss</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <h5 class="text-left">Automating The Deployment</h5>
        <p>
            The application was developed using Spring Boot & Spring Cloud. So, basically there is
            service registration, discovery and client side load balancing via Spring Cloud Eureka. Zuul is
            used for Api Gateway.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's the birds eye view of the automation :-
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pushing at specific branch of the remote github repository will trigger AWS CodePipeline</li>
            <li>Once, CodePipeline detect changes at repository, it will pull latest code & trigger CodeBuild</li>
            <li>Once CodeBuild is done, AWS CodeDeploy will push the build artifact at deployment server</li>
            <li>
                At Deployment server, each deploy-able jar (spring boot fat jar with embedded tomcat) is
                fused using Boxfuse
            </li>
            <li>
                Each boxfuse image then converted into Amazon Machine Image (AMI) & run within AutoScaling Group
                with predefine configuration (i.e. minimum number of instance, desired instance & max instances)
            </li>
            <li>
                At the end, a specific ELB is assigned to each autoscaling group for continuous health check
                which will ensure that any unhealthy instance will be replaced with fresh healthy instance
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br/>
        <h5 class="text-left">Conclusion</h5>
        <p>
            Of-course, automating microservice deployment is one of the most challenging tasks I have ever done.
            But when I was done with the task, there's another unavoidable complexity arises. When you know that
            one single push will end up creating 10 to 20 ec2 instance depending on the scaling configuration,
            you will be afraid of pushing at remote repo. It happened that I'm looking at the commit message and
            changes for few minutes, without any specific reason apart from the fear of <strong>If something went
            wrong!</strong>. At the end, I was saying to myself, <strong>"It's difficult to build a monster. But it's way
            more difficult to use a monster"</strong>.
