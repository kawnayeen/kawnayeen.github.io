                    those in whose hearts is deviation [from truth], they will follow that of it which is
                    unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them]. And no one
                    knows its [true] interpretation except Allah . But those firm in knowledge say, "We
                    believe in it. All [of it] is from our Lord." And no one will be reminded except those of
                    understanding.
