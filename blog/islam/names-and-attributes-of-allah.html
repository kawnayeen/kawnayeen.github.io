                    those in whose hearts is deviation [from truth], they will follow that of it which is
                    unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation [suitable to them]. And no one

            So, those who has <em> disease in his heart</em> play around the unspecific verses of Al-Quran and deviate
            from the religion.
        </p>
        <p> Now Allah describe himself clearly in the following verses :- </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
            <p class="text-left">
                <em><strong>
                    Say, "He is Allah , [who is] One; Allah , the Eternal Refuge.
                    He neither begets nor is born, Nor is there to Him any equivalent."

        <p> And in the greatest verse of the Quran, Allah has described his attributes in this way :- </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
            <p class="text-left">
                <em><strong>
                    Allah! La ilaha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Ever Living, the One
                    Who sustains and protects all that exists. Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him. To Him belongs
                    whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is he that can intercede with Him
                    except with His permission? He knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what
                    will happen to them in the Hereafter. And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except
                    that which He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and He feels no fatigue in
                    guarding and preserving them. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.

            So, when people go through these verses, where the modality is unknown, they deviate mainly
            in 2 way :-
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Doing <strong><em>Tahreef</em></strong> i.e. leaving out actual meaning understood by the
                specific word & take a meaning which the words may indicate in a doubtful sense. For example,
                saying <em><strong>Hand</strong> of Allah means <strong>Power</strong> of Allah</em>
            </li>
            <li>
                Doing <strong><em>Ta'teel</em></strong> i.e. denying the real meaning of the word. For example
                saying Allah don't have any <strong><em>Face</em></strong>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h5>
            Position of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama'ah in this regards : -
        </h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Believing in those Attributes with which Allah has qualified Himself and with which the
                Prophet (ﷺ) has qualified Allah.
            </li>
            <li>Making no alteration of actual meaning</li>
            <li>Stay away from denying the actual meaning</li>
            <li>Stay away from making likeness to creation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I'll end this article with a narration regarding Imam Malik which clearly demonstrate the above
            mention stance of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama'ah regarding name and attributes of Allah --  </p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
            <p class="text-left">
                <em><strong>
                    Abu Nu'aym relates from Ja'far Ibn Abdullah who said, "We were with Malik Ibn Anas, so
                    a man came, so he said, 'O Aba 'Abdullah, "The Most Merciful has ascended above His
                    Throne" [Surah Taha 20:5]. How has He ascended?' So anger came over Malik, such that
                    no affair like this had ever caused to come over him. So he looked towards the earth and
                    scratched with his cane in his hand, until he raised his hand and wiped the sweat from
                    his forehead, tossed the cane aside, and said, "The modality (kayhf) of it cannot be
                    comprehended by the intellect, and al-istiwa' (ascent) is not unknown, and having faith
                    in it is obligatory, and the question concerning it is an innovation. And I think you
                    are a person of innovation.' and he commanded him to leave."
