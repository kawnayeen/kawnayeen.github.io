            <strong>This is from the core belief of Muslims that Al-Quran is the word of Allah.</strong>
            Now if someone say that Quran is created (may Allah safeguard us from saying such), that imply Allah
            created his word. In other word, it is equivalent to say Allah created his own attribute and
            making such statement is clear act of disbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 9th Century, Abbasid Caliph Mamun adopted the <em>Mutazila doctrine</em> & they started
            to preach that Quran is creation. They went to the extreme of imprisoning & torturing those
            righteous scholars who rejected to accept such innovation. Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal was one of
            the scholars who were persecuted.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Imam Ahmad was brought in the court of Caliph Mu'tasim, he refuted all the logic of deviant
            Mutazila scholars infront of the people of Baghdad. When Mutazilaite scholars were defeated in the
            debate by Imam Ahmad & failed to bring any single proof from Quran and Sunnah to backup their
            claim, then Mu'tasim start lashing Imam Ahmad.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'll not go in details of the persecution of Imam Ahmad, amount and way of lashing the
            oppressor did to Imam Ahmad. Interested reader can check out the 10th volume of <em>Al-Bidaya
            wan-Nahiya</em> of Ibn Katheer. The point is, Imam Ahmad refused to accept deviant ideology, Imam
            Ahmad refused to utter word of disbelief; no matter how severe the lashing and persecution is. People
            of Baghdad was watching what Imam Ahmad do & He safeguarded <em>The Belief of Muslim</em> infront
            of them, He safeguarded the religion for the later generations to come. And Allah safeguarded his
            name and his legacy. May Allah have mercy on Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal.
